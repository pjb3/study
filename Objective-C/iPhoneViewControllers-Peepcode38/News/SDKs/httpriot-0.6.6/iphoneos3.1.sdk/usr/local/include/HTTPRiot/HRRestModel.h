/**
 * This class allows you to easily interact with RESTful resources.  Responses are automatically
 * converted to the proper Objective-C type.  You can use this class directly or subclass it.
 * 
 * Using this class directly means that all requests share the same configuration 
 * (including delegate).  This works fine for simple situations but when you start dealing 
 * with different resource types it's best to subclass HRRestModel, giving each class its 
 * own set of configuation options.
 *
 *
 * In the code below all requests originating from <tt>Person</tt> will have an <tt>api_key</tt> 
 * default parameter, the same base url, and the same delegate.  See HRResponseDelegate for the 
 * the delegate methods available to you.
 *
 * @code
 *  @implementation Person
 *  + (void)initialize {
 *     [self setDelegate:self];
 *     NSDictionary *params = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"1234567" forKey:@"api_key"];
 *     [self setBaseURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://localhost:1234/api"]];    
 *     [self setDefaultParameters:params];
 *  }
 *
 * + (void)restConnection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReturnResource:(id)resource object:(id)object {
 *      for(id person in resource) {
 *          // do something with a person dictionary   
 *      }  
 *  }
 *  @end
 *
 *  // Would send a request to http://localhost:1234/api/people/1?api_key=1234567
 *  [Person getPath:@"/people/1" withOptions:nil object:nil];
 * @endcode
 *
 * <h3>A note on default properties and subclassing</h3>
 * Each subclass has its own set of unique properties and these properties <em>are not</em>
 * inherited by any additional subclasses.

 * @li @b body <tt>NSData</tt>, <tt>NSString</tt> or <tt>NSDictionary</tt> - This option is used only during POST and PUT
 *     requests.  This option is eventually transformed into an NSData object before it is sent.

 *     then it's encoded as an NSData object.  If you supply an NSString, it's encoded as an NSData 
 *     object and sent.
