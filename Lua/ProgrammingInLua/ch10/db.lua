    Tecgraf is the result of a partnership between PUC-Rio,
    the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro,
    and <a href="http://www.petrobras.com.br/">PETROBRAS</a>,
    the Brazilian Oil Company.
    Tecgraf is Lua's birthplace,
    and the language has been used there since 1993.
    Currently, more than thirty programmers in Tecgraf use
    Lua regularly; they have written more than two hundred
    thousand lines of code, distributed among dozens of
    final products.]]
